# Motorcycle Security System with RFID and Servo Lock

## üèçÔ∏è Project Overview

This project implements an advanced security system for motorcycles using Arduino, RFID technology, and a servo-controlled lock mechanism. It provides a robust, user-friendly way to secure a motorcycle against unauthorized use or theft.

## üåü Features

- **RFID Authentication**: Secure access using pre-authorized RFID tags
- **Servo-Controlled Lock**: Physical locking mechanism for enhanced security
- **Obstacle Detection**: Prevents damage by detecting obstacles during locking
- **Visual and Audible Feedback**: LED and buzzer indicators for clear system status
- **Tamper Alert**: Triggers alarm on unauthorized access attempts
- **Lock Disable Feature**: Prevents accidental locking during ride
- **External Alarm Integration**: Compatible with existing alarm systems
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Self-checks and corrects ambiguous lock states

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motorcycle-security-system.git
   ```
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `motorcycle_security_system.ino` file.
3. Install the following libraries through the Arduino Library Manager:
   - MFRC522
   - Servo
4. Connect the hardware components according to the pin configuration.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## üîß Usage

1. Power ON the system.
2. Present an authorized RFID tag to lock/unlock the motorcycle.
3. The system will provide visual and audible feedback for each operation.
4. Use the Lock Disable switch when riding to prevent accidental locking.
